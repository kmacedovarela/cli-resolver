The cli-resolver is an [ELResolver](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/el/ELResolver.html) that allows you full access to the JBoss AS7 management model from a JSF page.  It also works with any other technology that uses the EE6 Expression Language (EL).  So it also works with JSP or Seam.  Its main use is to create a custom "Do It Yourself" web console for AS7.  If you are already familiar with JSF and AS7, you will find it very easy to create a simple web application to control and monitor your JBoss AS7 server.
